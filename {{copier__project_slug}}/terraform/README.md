# Terraform

This directory contains the Terraform configurations for the Scaf project. The
configurations are organized into several directories, each serving a specific
purpose. Below is a brief overview of each directory and instructions on how to
run the Terraform configurations.

## Directory Structure

- **bootstrap**: Bootstraps the Terraform state in an S3 bucket and a DynamoDB
  table. This configuration contains the states for all environments and only
  needs to be run once.

- **github**: Sets up a GitHub OIDC provider to allow GitHub to push container
  images to ECR repositories.

- **modules**: Contains a base module that is used by all environments.

- **prod**: Contains the configuration for the production environment.

- **sandbox**: Contains the configuration for the sandbox environment.

- **staging**: Contains the configuration for the staging environment.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: AWS Configuration

Ensure that you have installed AWS CLI version 2, as AWS SSO support is only
available in version 2 and above. Create a new AWS profile in `~/.aws/config`.
Here's an example of the `~/.aws/config` profile:

```
[profile scaf]
sso_start_url = https://sixfeetup.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = <replace with your AWS account id>
sso_role_name = admin
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

Note the `sso_role_name` setting above. Make sure to use a role that provides
you with the necessary permissions to deploy infrastructure on your AWS account.

Export the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:

```
$ export AWS_PROFILE=scaf
```
Then, to deploy to sandbox you can run:

```
$ task deploy-sandbox
```

TODO: replace with automation between the environment creation and the argocd bootstrap:


```
{% if copier__create_nextjs_frontend %}
6. After the environment is successfully deployed, note the CloudFront distribution ID that was created, and update the `DISTRIBUTION_ID` value in the corresponding kustomization.yaml file (e.g., sandbox/kustomization.yaml or production/kustomization.yaml) to reflect the correct value.
{% endif %}
